# Jekyll Include Body

This Jekyll plugin provides a Liquid tag that takes a relative path to .html file path and returns the contents of the \<body\> tag.
The intended usage is the same as of include_relative tag. Unlike include_relative, this tag strips out stuff like \<!DOCTYPE html\> and the \<head\> tags.
